Data
  [x] Make tabsbar and menuNav pull from same data source
  [x] possibly restructure so there is a 'show on tabsbar' t/f boolean instead of push/filter from array in current setup.
  [x] make navigation a separate component (instead of in portfolio template)
    [x] navigation to pull from 'children' child object on every browser template, that references/opens other templates.
      Can open child modules in new browser or new window with url
      [p] if child opened from menuNav, open parent browser but with that tab open.
  refactor to vuex store

Bugs
  [x] bring window to front when clicked
  [x] resize is acting buggy from top left/right corners
    [x] might resolve if move .interact method to index mounted instead of on every browser.vue instance
  z-index does not update on browser drag, only on click
  Need more precise scaling on modules when resizing browser window
  move navbar to separate element outside of container so browsers do not get stuck underneath
