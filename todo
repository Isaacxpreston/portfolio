  add 'minimize', 'maximize', 'close' labels to browser buttons

Data
  [x] Make tabsbar and menuNav pull from same data source
    [x] possibly restructure so there is a 'show on tabsbar' t/f boolean instead of push/filter from array in current setup.
    [x] make navigation a separate component (instead of in portfolio template)
          navigation to pull from 'children' child object on every browser template, that references/opens other templates.
          Can open child modules in new browser or new window with url
            if opened from menuNav, open parent browser but with that tab open.

Bugs
  [x] bring window to front when clicked
  Need more precise scaling on modules when resizing browser window
  resize is acting buggy from top left/right corners
    might resolve if move .interact method to index mounted instead of on every browser.vue instance
  z-index does not update on browser drag, only on click
